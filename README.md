# Coding Guidelines

## Function Guidelines

One of the more universal, yet simple rules is: Function names should be verbs if the function changes the state of the program, and nouns if they're used to return a certain value.

## Commit Guidelines

### Adding Files
```
git commit -m '🎉 Add: .gitignore file'
```

### Deleting Files
```
git commit -m '🔥 Delete: Block Lab Plugin'
```

### Updating Files
```
git commit -m '🚀 Update:  News Carousel styles'
```

### Fixing Bugs
```
git commit -m '🐛 Fix: Media Conditional'
```

### Building New Features
```
git commit -m '✨ Build: Image Gallery'
```

### Notes / CE Lesson
```
git commit -m '🍎 Lesson: SVG Paths'
```


You might also consider adding to your commit the url to 
a task if you are using some sort of Project Managment Software
like Teamwork or Monday.com. For example, 
### Fixing Bugs
```
git commit -m 'Fix: Media Conditional
<url here>'
```
to reference the fix and the url for future developers in case they need to reference a previously fixed bug that has resurfaced.
